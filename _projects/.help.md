# Main Help File

Hi! Welcome to prose.io! This is where you can edit the content of your site or add new content and post it online. All files (including this one) are formatted in Markdown, a simple syntax designed to convert easy-to-write plain text into web-readable HTML.

The buttons in your toolbar will help your format text the way you want, but keep in mind that it's not the *buttons* that do anything, it's the _charachters_ (like the asterisk and underscore) that change the way the text will be read and displayed. All these syntax rules are available [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). If you're feeling fancy or need something particular, you can even write in-line HTML.

Most Markdown files will also contain **metadata**, which includes special information like the title and date. You can view the metadata for any file by clicking on the metadata icon on the right of the screen. Try it now!

When you are finished editting a file, click on the save icon to open up the commit panel. In the text box, summarize the changes you just made (i.e. "new project" or "fixed typo"), then click commit. This will update or add the file to the GitHub repository and rebuild the site automatically.

## Projects

You are currently in the projects directory of your website. Each project gets its own Markdown file, located here. Create a new project by creating a new file. The main text field is where you write the *description* for the project. The rest of the relevant info (date, image, media link) is defined through metadata.
