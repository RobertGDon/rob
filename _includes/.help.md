# Includes Help

You are in the includes folder! Here you can edit various miscellanious snippets of text that are used throughout the site. These may be divided into subfolders based on their type, but they are all formatted identically.

All the files here are formatted in basic Markdown and editted in the main text area. Includes do not use any frontmatter.

Adding a new file here will do nothing, unless it is called by another file using Liquid syntax:

```
{% include <filename> %}
```

You may want to do this if you find yourself regularly repeating content in different parts of the site, or if you want to be able to update all such content simultaneously.

Deleting includes may break certain aspects of the site.
